    <h1>Strategies</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods: Opt for fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins instead of heavily processed foods. Whole foods generally have fewer additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients, reducing the intake of potentially harmful chemicals.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Read food labels and ingredient lists: Become familiar with the ingredients commonly used in processed foods and avoid products with a long list of artificial additives, high levels of sodium or sugar, or ingredients you cannot pronounce. Choose foods with minimal additives and ingredients that are natural and recognizable.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Cook meals from scratch: Preparing meals at home gives you more control over the ingredients you use. By cooking from scratch, you can minimize reliance on processed foods and have a better understanding of the chemicals that go into your meals.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Wash fruits and vegetables: Thoroughly wash fresh produce under running water to remove any surface residues, including pesticides and dirt. Consider using a vegetable brush for produce with tougher skins or peels.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Peel or remove outer leaves: For fruits and vegetables with edible peels or outer leaves, consider peeling or removing them when appropriate. This can help reduce exposure to certain pesticides or contaminants that may be more concentrated on the outer layers.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Limit processed meats and charred/grilled foods: Processed meats often contain additives and preservatives, and high-temperature cooking methods like grilling or charring can produce potentially harmful compounds. Reduce consumption of processed meats and use gentler cooking methods like steaming, boiling, or baking.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Store and reheat food properly: Store food in appropriate containers and follow safe storage practices to prevent cross-contamination and microbial growth. When reheating food, avoid using plastic containers or plastic wrap in the microwave, as chemicals can leach into the food.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:28px;">*Stay hydrated with clean water: Choose clean, filtered water for drinking and cooking to reduce exposure to contaminants like heavy metals or chemicals that may be present in tap water.</p>

        <p style="color: indigo; font-size:30px;">*Practice moderation and balance: Maintaining a balanced and varied diet is key to overall health and reducing the potential risks of chemicals in food. Incorporate a wide range of nutrient-dense foods and practice portion control to support a healthy lifestyle.</p>
